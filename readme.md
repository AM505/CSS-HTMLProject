# Design of the website
The website is designed as one page with links to the septate sections. The website was originally going to be multiple pages, however it would have lead to very sparse pages. 
 
## Wireframes

The initial wireframes from the design phase can be seen here.

## Fonts and Colour Scheme


## Images
All images are from the site [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/).
Ideally images would be all the same aspect ratio. 

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was originally a pale red, black and white. Where the text was black. However the contrast was too low and would make the site hard to read, especially on smaller screens or for users with visual impairment.
Therefore, the text was changed to white on a pale red background. 

This site was used to check accessibility:
